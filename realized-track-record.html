            <h2>QRT Real vs model without fees</h2>
            <p>The chart below represents the accumulated PnL net of execution fees 
                <span style="color: slategrey;background-color: #fff;">(QRT cumulative Net PnL)</span> traded in QRT's paper lab 
                since August 31st 2023 extracted from the QSec_Detailed_DP_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx, the effective start of our evaluation.<br><br>
                In gold, we have the 'theoretical' cumulative gross PnL 
                <span style="color: gold;background-color: #fff;">(Theo cumulative Gross PnL)</span> of the tracked paper model. Some remarks:<br>
                - Perfect execution.<br>
                - No execution fees.<br>
                - We can see how the model performed since October 2nd 2024.<br><br>

            <h2>Fees incurred</h2>
            <p>
                Let's incorporate the actual execution fees incurred in real life with QRT pricing scale into the paper model.<br>
                For the Emini SP, they have been about: F * 1.25bp * 60DayReturnVol% * 100 $ per contract.<br>
                For the STOXX50, they have been about: F * 1.375bp * 60DayReturnVol% * 100 â‚¬ per contract.<br>
                As for October 30th 2024, the total fees paid to QRT have been 621000$.

            <h2>QRT Real vs model net of fees</h2>
            <p>
                The chart below impacts the gold paper curve with the actual fees incurred. <br>
                We can notice that in early October
                we still beat the paper model, even with fees amounting to 621k$.

                Let's get visibility on one more point. The 13th of February 2024 is an outlier: it is a "cas d'ecole" of what I claim
                I capture. <br>There are several factors under investigations as I write which yield a "faisceau de convergence" as to when a higher probability 
                day might unfold.<br>
                That particular Tuesday was one of those and I acted in consequence. In effect placing all the risk on the US markets, and from
                Monday evening. <br>In hindsight, it was the optimal line of action.<br>
                Let's override the QRT PL by the theoretical paper one, whic is almost half, and see what we have then.
            </p>
            <h2>QRT Real vs model net of fees and outlier removed</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to removing the outlier, I stop the chart at the last executed trade on the server, just for the sake of tracking executability.
