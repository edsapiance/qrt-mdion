            <p>Letâ€™s go back to the realised track record.<br>
                For the sake of <strong>risk analysis and statistics</strong>, we are going to assume that the trades bypassed in October have been executed without noise.<br> 
                They figure in purple on the chart, and are the continuation of the traded golden yellow curve.<br><br>

                <br><br>
                As traders, we are interested in :
                <ul>
                    <li>an ex-ante measure of risk, at trade inception.</li>
                    <li>an ex-post realised risk, once the market has rendered its verdict.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Ideally, the ex-ante measure is a good predictor, a good estimation, of the risk taken.
            </p>
            <h2>Ex-post Realised Risk</h2>
            <p>
                The realized $ volatility of the program in 2024 is $1.5 million , 25% less than the allocated $2 million.<br><br>
                On a 60 business day rolling window, a quarter of a year, the unit favored by QRT, the extreme values
                 have been: <br>$1.9 million on October 22nd and $855000  on July 31st.<br><br>
                 We have spent 57% of the time below the mean, and never reached the full allocated risk when above.<br><br>
                <iframe src="TR_realized_risk.html" width="75%" height="600"></iframe>
            </p>
            <h2>Ex-Ante Risk Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                From the QSEC user guide, we get the following guidelines:<br><br>
            Risk calculation<br>
            To compute the risk of your portfolio, all your current positions on all the asset classes are considered. 
            The process to get the risk measure is:<br>
		    - Select the last 60 daily returns for all the instruments<br>
            - Compute the book's daily PnL series that you would have had with today's position<br>
		    - Compute the standard deviation of these daily PnL<br>	
            - Multiply by the square root of 252<br>
            <br>
            With practice, and as we started building the track record, the following remarks might be inferred (tbc):<br><br>
            Risk scales with the square root of time with day as the atomic component.<br>
            Intraday strategies are reported on top of the previous days positions risk in our case<br>
            It seems that positions between SP500 and Eurostoxx50 are netted out notionally when they are in opposite directions (one long vs one short)<br>
            Risk metrics are annualised assuming the strategy is traded every business day (in effect scaling by the square root of 252)<br>
            <br>
            I have reconstructed a close approximation of the QSEC-reports, with conservative differences from the original:<br>
            The main one is not netting the markets against each other when one market is long, the other one short.<br><br>
            <iframe src="TR_qsec_risk.html" width="75%" height="600"></iframe>
            <br><br>
            To the eye, it certainly seems that much risk has been taken to produce the PL: excursions above the dashed red line of $2million annualized
            are plenty.<br>
            And yet the realized standard deviation of the PL is $1.5 million. How come?<br>
            Let's do something forbidden and show the sum of the mean of the solid black (day to day) and dashed blue (intraday) lines.<br>
            Forbidden because risk doesn't scale linearly and that is the difficulty.<br><br>
            <iframe src="TR_qsec0_risk.html" width="75%" height="600"></iframe>
            <br>
            This time, the green dashed line stands at <strong>$1.2 million</strong> (hover the mouse on the left hand side of it). It is the sum of the average of both 
            the solid black line and the dashed blue line.<br>
            <p style="color: #8b0000; font-weight: bold;">This is for the sake of demonstration, we cannot technically do that since risk does not scale linearly. We do get a hint however.</p>
            Remember the strategy is traded from Monday 16:30 London time to Tuesday 21:00 London time.<br>
            Both markets are traded one after the other, with only a 2 hours overlap, so that even summing them up is not accurate.<br>
            In addition, annualizing with a scaling of \( \sqrt{252} \) assumes continuous trading everyday, with the PL continuing to drift according to that 
            diffusion from Tuesday night to the next Monday.<br>
            This is not the case. The anchor established until the next trading opportunity remains the same from Tuesday night to the next Monday 16:30.<br>
            <br>
            As a conclusion, and the most accurate heuristic to get a proper evaluation of the yearly risk taken by QRT with the program QTRS is to use
            a scaling factor of \( \sqrt{52} \). This is what the QSec-report would look like, reconciling the ex-ante and the ex-post measures.<br>
