        <h1>Quant Total Return <i>systems</i>: A Subtle Breakthrough
        </h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Conceived by <span class="highlight">Edmond Turquieh</span>, <span class="subtle"> formerly</span> the CIO and owner of Sapiance Capital, Quant Total Return <i>systems</i> (QTRs) is the culmination of experience and refined expertise in alternative investment strategies. Turquieh’s journey—from building and managing <span class="highlight">Sapiance Capital</span>, to collaborating closely with renowned quantitative experts like <a href="http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bacry/" class="highlight" target="_blank">Emmanuel Bacry</a>
                and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=i2MC67AAAAAJ&hl=en" class="highlight" target="_blank">Jean-François Muzy</a>—has shaped a strategy that stands out in the world of systematic trading.
            </p>

            <h2>An Approach Rooted in Experience and Precision</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Sapiance Capital</span>, under Turquieh's leadership, operated as an FCA-authorized firm in London, leveraging advanced trading algorithms with a focus on robustness and longevity. It’s from this rich background that <span class="highlight">QTRs</span> has emerged, carefully designed to thrive in today’s evolving market conditions. <span class="highlight">It is a strategy that does not seek to chase every market movement, but rather to capture the most meaningful ones.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>Designed for Those Who Recognize True Value</h2>
            <p>QTRs offers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Targeted Exposure:</span> The model remains out of the market more than <span class="subtle">70%</span> of the time, focusing on opportunities where signal clarity is highest. This precision means that when the system moves, it does so with purpose, aiming to align with the deeper flows of institutional behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Risk Calibration with Discipline:</span> Annual volatility is kept under <span class="subtle">10%</span>, with returns aiming for a consistent <span class="highlight">15%</span>. This careful balance provides a solid foundation, allowing for controlled growth without unnecessary exposure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Execution with Scale:</span>
                        Developed for high-volume markets, QTRs integrates seamlessly into the operations of large hedge funds, ensuring that slippage is minimized, and theoretical models remain effective even as trade sizes increase.
                    </ul>
        
                    <h2>From Insight to Implementation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Turquieh's collaborations with <span class="highlight">Bacry</span> and <span class="highlight">Muzy</span> have enriched QTRs with sophisticated methodologies, blending stochastic insights with practical market knowledge. The result is a systematic program that navigates the subtle dynamics of post-weekend market adjustments—unearthing opportunities that less nuanced models might miss.
                    </p>
